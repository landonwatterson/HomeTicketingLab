<h1>Self Hosted Ticketing System Lab - Creating Users, Tickets & Closing Tickets </h1>

 

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of creating my own home ticketing system via an open source software called Peppermint. This software was ran on a Linux Ubuntu VM via VirtualBox. This software allowed me to simulate day-to-day helpdesk tasks such as creating tickets, updating status on tickets and closing them when they are completed.
